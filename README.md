# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## How to run it

You can run by first installing the packages:

`yarn install`

And running the server:

`yarn dev`

And then opening at:

`http://localhost:5173/todo-app/home`

## Testing

Run:

`yarn test`

### Notes

Surely more tests could be added, like in depth on components, even more integration or using e2e. But even though I finished it while having time, my agenda/schedule today was not so good and I have to rest now.
